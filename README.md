# todo_list

A new Flutter project.

-The todo_List app contains a beautiful UI/UX design that gives the user a sense of satisfaction when they finish a task through added animations. I also added functionality to the help section of the navigation bar which once clicked, redirects the user to web page that teaches them how to manage their todo list on an external browser's tab.


I also made an improvement on the search bar functionality as well as on the display of the todo-list items i.e New todo list items should always appear at the top of the page.
